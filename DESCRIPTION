Description: Implements several safe graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms. The first algorithm is the Semi-Supervised Semi-Parametric Model (S4PM) and the fast Anchor Graph version of this approach.  For additional technical details, refer to Culp and Ryan (2013) <http://jmlr.org/papers/v14/culp13a.html>, Ryan and Culp (2015) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/ryan15a.html> and the package vignette. The underlying fitting routines are executed in C++. All tuning parameter estimation is optimized using K-fold Cross-Validation.
